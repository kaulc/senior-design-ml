# senior-design-ml

This program creates a classifier neural network model. The program outputs the predicted values and confidence of prediction in a table format. The model is run on magnitude and phase of collected CSI data. 

The most up-to-date code is located in: csi_model7.py

To run this model locally, create a virtual environment and execute the file using the command 'python csi_model7.pyâ€™.

This message prints every time the program executes:

tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

This is to be expected. This message describes some optimization capabilities of Tensorflow. If this creates an issue, I can find a way to suppress the message.
